Date Management System

Project Overview

The Date Management System is a Java-based application that allows users to create, update, and manage dates efficiently. It provides various functionalities, including:
 • Validating and storing dates
 • Printing dates in a human-readable format
 • Retrieving the day of the week for a given date
 • Calculating the difference in days between two dates
 • Sorting dates in ascending order
 • Handling invalid inputs gracefully

The system features an interactive menu-driven user interface, enabling users to perform these actions dynamically.
Additional Notes & Challenges

1. Leap Year Handling

The program correctly accounts for leap years, allowing February 29th only in valid leap years (e.g., 2024, 2028).

2. Exception Handling

If a user enters an invalid date (e.g., February 30), the program displays an error message and prevents invalid entries.

3. Sorting Mechanism

Dates are sorted based on year → month → day to maintain chronological order.

4. Edge Cases Considered
 • Adding and managing multiple dates
 • Handling invalid choices in the menu
 • Preventing calculations when insufficient dates exist

This project is a great starting point for understanding date manipulation, user input handling, and sorting in Java.
